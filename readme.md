# MAVELA - a computational tool for simulating field water managment
This tool simulated field water managment at any location in Finland. 
The tool uses open data sources to generate metheorological inputs.
User can define the following parameters for the simulated field:
- Year of simulation
- Drainage type
- Drain spacing
- Drain depth
- Slope of the field
